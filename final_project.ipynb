    "We found that the three metrics used would be a fairly good starting point for measuring the \"best\" neighborhood to raise children. Though if we were to add more metrics I believe that \"quality of life\" or \"healthiness\" of neighborhoods could be used or something similar to that. However, we believe that a low crime rate would leave a safer environment for children. Playgrounds would be a good source of fun for children that would help cultivate a better future. And education is evidently optimal in order to guarantee children a more knowledgeable life."
